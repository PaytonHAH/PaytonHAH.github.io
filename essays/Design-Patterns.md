## Instructions

When a restaurant wants to franchise its business, it still wants to preserve its unique feeling but from somewhere unlike its original location. It has a brand to keep up, and if their franchises are not up to par, that brand could fall off. 

As quoted from Christopher Alexander, 1977 from the material of this section, [A design pattern] "describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."
