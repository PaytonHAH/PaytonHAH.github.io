## UI Frameworks?
What is a UI Framework? From what I understand, it is a set of tools that make developing UI (User Interfaces) easier to develop. Some may argue that it isn't easier while others see it make developing a lot easier. One UI Framework we have used is Bootstrap 5, which can be a hurdle to overcome. Using Bootstrap 5, we have access to many different tools like containers which, compared to raw html and css may be a lot. Like any coding language, or any language in general, it takes time, mistakes, and practice to master. When you first learn to code, you didn't master in the day, and the same applies to the UI Framework. Having this tool set, can take time away from thinking how to do trivial things, so we have more time to think about bigger problems, overall saving on stress. Sure we could just use raw html and css, but we could also code in one's and zero's as well, instead of using a coding language. 

## My experience
In ICS 314, we so far have used Bootstrap 5. My experience of it is a mixed bag so far, but that's not too strange, as this feels like when I first started to program. As of right now, I'm slow with it, and I have to constantly refer to the Bootstrap 5 document and previous projects that have utilized Bootstrap 5. I get stuck on what I believe are trivial problems, and I sit there looking at the screen, a mess of div and classes. But when I do finish, it looks similar to what the final product should look like, but its off, almost like the website came from an alternate universe. Overtime, as I practice "remaking" websites, I feel I'll reach literacy as I have with coding.
