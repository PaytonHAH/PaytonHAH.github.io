## What is a question?
Questions are lifeblood of what makes us human. Without questioning the world around us and why things are, would be any different from what we are today? Some may argue that the ability to question is what makes us human. With the thought provoking hook out of the way, why even worry about making good questions in the first place? "I am curious about something and I need answers now!", some may argue, which can come from a place of genuine curiousity or borderline childish tendancies, but regardless, most of time, you'll get an answer of the same magnitude. Ask a bad question, get a bad answer, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This is why it is important to be able to ask smart questions, especially over the internet. On the internet, unless from an online voice chat or video call, people can't read you and the only thing they can do is read you face value. You are doing the samething with my writing, which I hope you see me in a good light. With all of this in mind, what is an example of a bad question? What is an example of a smart question? The following is are scenarios of such questions.

## Bad Question
<img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/smart-questions/4blja.png">
"HELLO EVERYONE, THIS HOMEWORK PROBLEM IS DUE IN LIKE 2 HOURS AND I ONLY STARTED LIKE 10 MINUTES AGO, I NEED HELP NOWWWWWW!!!!!!" I hope this exemplifies some key aspects of a bad question. One is the lack of being explict with the question. They were not clear with what exactly is wrong, and the blurry photo was no help either. They essentially posted a plea for help along with pushing on the burden that this person needs the answer now. People get nothing from this, leading to leading to answers like "Good Luck" or "We can't help you" or a whole host of other responses that will not be fruitful for the poster.
