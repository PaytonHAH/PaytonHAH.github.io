## Coding Standards?

## Benefits I've Seen
In ICS 314, we use ESLint together with Intellij. Compared to previous IDE's I've used, so far I think Intellij is probably the best one I've used. I love the ease of use with this IDE and it is very clean, similar to Eclipse, but I feel more gravitated to this new one, maybe recency bias. In combination with ESLint, I find that the IDE actually points out breaches in code standards is very helpful. Having a tool that tells me the problem and gives a suggestion to solve that issue, gives me reassurance that I'm coding correctly and I can avoid most problems. Assuming coding standards are similar to coding style, I can see why people can hate it. For example, in ICS 212, while an excellent class, we had to code with Vi, which is the most bare bones way I have ever coded, and it was terrible because I also had to follow a coding style. Indentation requirements and a bunch of other rules, I can see why someone might hate them. I would have to comb through my programs just to double check whether or not my indentations were four white spaces, which now experiences ESLint, would have been a awesome at the time. Experiencing both sides of the coin has made me appreciate the standards, but having tools that remind me of them.
